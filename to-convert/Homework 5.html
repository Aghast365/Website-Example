<p>Construct a Turing machine with one tape that receives as input a non-negative integer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and returns as output the integer <span class="math inline">\(x + 1\)</span>. Integers are represented as binary strings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give an informal description (in plain English) of a Turing machine with one tape that receives as input two non-negative integers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and returns as output the integer <span class="math inline">\(x + y\)</span>. Integers are represented as binary strings. If you are an adventurous student, you may give a formal definition of your Turing machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This turing machine would be a modification of the one defined in 4.4. With the head of both tapes starting at the lowest bit of each number, if the second tape head reads a 1, then the same method as the previous turing machine is used to add 1 to the number in the first tape. Then, the head of both tapes is moved back to the beginning of the first tape, the lowest bit on the second tape it is set to the blank symbol, and the algorithm is repeated starting from the next lowest bit on the second tape, until the second tape is fully consumed.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">4.9</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Construct a Turing machine with one tape that receives as input a string of the form <span class="math inline">\(1^n\)</span> for some integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>; thus, the input is a string of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> many <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. The output of the Turing machine is the string <span class="math inline">\(1^n\square1^n\)</span>. Thus, this Turing machine makes a copy of its input.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The input alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{1\}\)</span> and the tape alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \{1, \square\}\)</span>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Start of the computation: The tape contains a string of the form <span class="math inline">\(1^n\)</span>, for some integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span>, the tape head is on the leftmost symbol, and the Turing machine is in the start state. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span>, the tape looks as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>End of the computation: The tape contains the string <span class="math inline">\(1^n\square1^n\)</span>, the tape head is on the <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span> in the middle of this string, and the Turing machine is in the final state. For our example, the tape looks as follows:</p>
